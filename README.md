# Polytrack_Codes

This repository contains codes for my Polytrack maps

I aim to create Polytrack maps that guide the player through a story, rather than just another route.
Whether through decoration or routing, I strive to maximize the quality of my work.
My favorite styles to build are transitional fullspeed and speedtech, but trial can be fun too.

Have fun playing, and I hope you enjoy my work
