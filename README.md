# Polytrack_Codes

Mission:
This repository contains codes for my Polytrack maps

About Me:
I strive to create Polytrack maps that demonstrate and convey specific themes, placing the player within a story rather than just a track.
My favorite styles to build are transitional fullspeed and trial.
Whether through decoration or routing, I always strive to maximize the quality of my work.
