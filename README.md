# Polytrack_Codes

This repository contains codes for my Polytrack maps

I strive to create Polytrack maps that demonstrate and convey specific themes, placing the player within a story rather than just a track.
Whether through decoration or routing, I always strive to maximize the quality of my work.
For the most part, my favorite styles to build are transitional fullspeed and trial.

Have fun playing, and I hope you enjoy my work
